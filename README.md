# Finding Nearest B-Cycle station in Denver

The idea of this map comes from [this Mapbox example](https://www.mapbox.com/labs/turf-bikeshare/), but in a more manageble scale. The idea is to identify the [nearest](http://turfjs.org/static/docs/module-turf_nearest.html) [B-Cyle](https://denver.bcycle.com/) station from a draggable point.
